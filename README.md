Frank-Wolfe methods for Recommender Systems
==============================


The final project created for Optimization for Data Science course.

The project covers application of two important algorithms designed for constraint optimization tasks: Frank-Wolfe and Projected Gradient.

Introduced code is aimed to demonstrate the algorithms' performance for real world Recommender System task. In order to do that, we have selected Netflix Prize as such a task, formalized it as constrained and convex optimization problem, applied the algorithms to that problem.
